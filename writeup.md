## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1643/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---

### Writeup

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  

You are reading it! Below I describe how I addressed each rubric point and where in my code each point is handled.

### Implemented Controller

#### 1. Implemented body rate control in C++. (Scenario 2)

#### 2. Implement roll pitch control in C++. (Scenario 2)

#### 3. Implement altitude controller in C++. (Scenario 3, 4)

#### 4. Implement lateral position control in C++. (Scenario 3)

#### 5. Implement yaw control in C++. (Scenario 3)

#### 6. Implement calculating the motor commands given commanded thrust and moments in C++.  (Scenario 2)

### Flight Evaluation

#### Your C++ controller is successfully able to fly the provided test trajectory and visually passes inspection of the scenarios leading up to the test trajectory.
